Gil Meron,gil@sproutagritech.com,"Mr. Meron,

I'm Victor G. Zarco, CFA Bs. in Actuarial Science and Financial Economist.  
I came across your leadership in Yarden Group, particularly Your impactful strides in AgTech and CleanTech sectors with Yarden Group have genuinely piqued my interest..

I'm moving to the Middle East soon and eager to foster relationships within this magnificent region. That's why I'd greatly appreciate a short call with you.

Most recently, I've  
* supported a seven-figure equity raise for a U.S. diagnostics company,  
* co-founded a consumer wellness brand in Mexico, scaling it nationwide through e-commerce, and  
* partnered VC startups with tier-one brands such as lululemon.  

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to explore potential synergies with Yarden?

Best regards,  
Victor Gutierrez, CFA
